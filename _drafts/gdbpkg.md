I have a love/hate relationship with GDB. On one hand, it's a wonderful tool and
debugger, it's works with almost _anything_ I want to attach to it, it has a
remote protocol which allows for custom GDB servers and front-ends, and it has a
powerful extensibility story using GDB command scripts and Python (and, err,
Guile).

Now for the aspects of GDB that I don't love.

Last but not least, and what is probably the biggest problem with GDB today, is
that many developers would rather use `printf` debugging or an inferior IDE
wrapper over learning and using GDB.

<!-- excerpt start -->

GDB desperately needs a better way to package and distribute scripts and plugins
to enhance the user experience and encourage sharing common debugging utilities
and techniques.

## Backstory

I started doing embedded development at Pebble, the smart watch maker, and it's where I first treaded into the deep in with GDB. It's also where I first learned about GDB's Python API. 

One of the firmware engineers on the team wrote a script to pretty-print a summary of the heap for a device connected to GDB using the Python API. It was **awesome**. But, using this script with GDB wasn't without its problems, but we slowly made improvements to our collection of scripts and our workflows. A few notable improvements were:

- Add more scripts for each of our critical modules in the firmware, such as state machines, Bluetooth state, etc.
- Instead of just printing the heap allocations, expose the heap through a Python Class. e.g. `heap = Heap(g_heap); total_size = sum([b.size] for b in heap.iter_blocks()])`. 
- [Wrapping the GDB invocation]({% post_url 2019-08-27-building-a-cli-for-firmware-projects %}#a-project-cli ) and loading GDB Python scripts automatically so every developer on the team had them loaded and ready to use at all times.

This was all back in 2015 or so. As I've moved around to other companies and talked to many other embedded software developers, I've discovered that many of them have never thought to extend GDB using scripts, and even more had not heard of GDB's Python API.

## Consequences of GDB's Lack of Plugin Manager

What has happened in the GDB ecosystem due to not having a plugin manager?

### No Forward Progress




### Poor Debugging Experience

For context, I'm an embedded developer and I write software for devices that run on bare-metal, ARM Cortex-M4/M7 MCU's with about 256 KB of RAM, 1-16 MB of persistent flash, and clocking in at around 100 MHz. Within this past year, I've worked with four different MCU's, 7 different Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS's), and a handful of common low-level software libraries including Mbed TLS, the WICED Bluetooth Stack, and many mediocre vendor SDK's. 

That's probably a bit more diversity than the average embedded developer given I work for a company who's job it is to build integrations into every embedded software package, but I want to bring up a point. 

I'm using GDB frequently to debug, read and write memory and state variables, and to help me understand what goes on behind the scenes in vendor libraries and hardware. The experience that I have on a daily basis **sucks**. 

**Debugging even the most popular C/C++/Rust software packages is a huge pain**. 



### Lack of Awareness and Community

### Monolithic Projects










The story around GDB and it's extensibility today is sad. The fact that GDB is
scriptable through GDB command sequences, Python, and even GNU
Guile[^extending_gdb] shows that the core developers are trying to allow people
to extend GDB. However, the community hasn't run with this idea in any
significant way.

Most new developer tools today need to be _easily_ extensible. Integrations are
usually a core feature of these products.

GDB's extensibility story is almost exactly the same as Vim's. On launch, GDB
load's a series of `.gdbinit` files in configured folders[^gdb_startup]

## Life with a GDB Plugin Manager

I'd like to now paint a picture that is possible if we take the time to clean up, share, and install GDB scripts that we all have stored somewhere in our local `~/.gdbinit` or stored away in some old repo.

1. I start a new project which uses the Zephyr RTOS as an operating system. 
2. I install the Zephyr GDB plugin so I can view information about the threads, heaps, block pools, mutexes, and global state variables all in GDB.
3. I to pull in the Mbed TLS library to be able to connect to secure servers.
4. I install the Mbed TLS GDB plugin so that I again can look at the libraries global state to help my debugging experience.
5. I find a bug in the Zephyr GBD plugin due to a global variable name change. I fork the plugin, fix the bug, and the maintainer publishes a new version of the plugin and now everyone can update. 

The only thing we need to allow the above to happen is a standard way to write, package, publish, and install these plugins. I'm constantly amazed that our IDE's, GUI based text editors, and even Vim have plugin managers, and I feel that GDB desperately needs one too. 


## GDB's Current Extensibility Hooks

There are essentially three "built-in" ways to automatically load GDB scripts
upon launch.

### Using `--command` Argument

GDB allows loading and executing scripts using the `--command <file>` and
`--eval-command <command>` arguments. This is the one I recommend everyone to
use and personally use within all of my projects.

For example, we can load a local file called `hello.gdb` which contains a GDB
command called `hello`.

```
# hello.gdb

define hello
echo "Hello World from .gdb\n"
end
```

To load this when we launch GDB, we can use `--command /path/to/hello.gdb`

```
$ gdb --command hello.gdb

(gdb) help user
User-defined commands.
The commands in this class are those defined by the user.
Use the "define" command to define a command.

List of commands:

hello -- User-defined

(gdb) hello
Hello World from .gdb
```

You can also load GDB Python scripts using this technique as well. Let's create
a `hello_py` command in a file `hello.py`.

```python
# hello.py

import gdb

class HelloPy(gdb.Command):
    def __init__(self):
        super(HelloPy, self).__init__('hello_py', gdb.COMMAND_USER)

    def invoke(self, _unicode_args, _from_tty):
        print("Hello World from .py")

HelloPy()
```

```
$ gdb --command hello.py
(gdb) hello_py
Hello World from .py
```

If you don't want to keep typing `--command ...` every time you launch GDB, or
trying to convince or remind your co-workers to do the same, I suggest [wrapping
the GBD invocation with a
CLI]({% post_url 2019-08-27-building-a-cli-for-firmware-projects %}).

### objfile-gdb.ext File

The next way that GDB allows you to auto-load extensions is by matching the
object name to a script. Let's run through an example of this as well. Let's
create a c file called `test.c`.

```c
// test.c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("%s\n", "Hello World");
}
```

Next, we'll compile it into a binary named `myexe.out`.

```
$ gcc -g test.c -o myexe.out
```

Now that we have an executable called `myexe.out`, we can create a script file
named `<object_file_name>-gdb.gdb`, or in our case `myexe.out-gdb.gdb`, and GDB
will load it for us automatically.

> NOTE: GDB will auto load scripts from the directories listed in the command
> `show auto-load scripts-directory` or from thee current working directory.

For this example, we'll copy our previous file.

```
$ cp hello.gdb myexe.out-gdb.gdb
```

We can now launch GDB without nay extra arguments other than the executable and
verify that the command is loaded.

```
$ gdb myexe.out
(gdb) hello
Hello World from .gdb
```

It also works with GDB Python scripts, however the filename must end with
`-gdb.py`.

### .debug_gdb_scripts Section

Upon loading an ELF file, GDB will also look for a section called
`.debug_gdb_scripts`. This section can contain either filenames (e.g.
`gdb_scripts.py`) or full scripts, like the `HelloPy` script we wrote above.

While I admit that this functionality is clever, it means that the information
is hard-coded in the ELF file and can't be easily changed at a later date.
Adding a filename or fixing a bug in an embedded script would require [creative
uses of GNU binutils]([Conda]({% post_url 2020-04-08-gnu-binutils %})) and some
work re-distributing the ELF files.

## It Doesn't Have To Be Awful

Let's take Vim for example. Vim's plugins are, at their core, a collection of
`.vim` files written in Vimscript packaged up. These "plugins" are distributed
and installed on a user's computer with one of the many Vim plugin managers,
such as [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) or
[Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).

These Vim plugins range in functionality from new language syntax support,
integrations with common tools like git and grep, and even alterations to the
user-interface to make things colored, formatted, and more efficient.

What I'm trying to say is...**GDB should have a similar plugin architecture to
Vim**

## Life with a Package Manager

- You've written

## `gdbundle` - GDB's Plugin Manager

gdbundle is short for GDB bundle and is a plugin manager for GDB.

To quickly summarize, gdbundle plugins:

- can be automatically loaded by `gdbundle`.
- are Python 2 and 3 compatible.
- can be distributed through PyPi within Python packages.
- can be installed using `pip`, `poetry`, etc.
- can be installed into virtual environments to prevent version collisions.
- can wrap pre-existing GDB plugins/scripts, such as
  [cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard](https://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard), so that
  modifying the original package is not necessary.

gdbundle tries to remain simple, un-opinionated, and delegates most of the work
of loading the plugin to the plugin itself. Let's go over how it works! It won't
take long.

In order and by default, gdbundle:

1. Searches for installed Python packages that begin with `gdbundle_`.
2. Calls the `gdbundle_load()` function of each plugin module.
3. In each plugin's `gdbundle_load()` function, it will source, import, and
   configure the GDB scripts that it has bundled inside (or from another package
   by way of a dependency).

And that is all.

### Requirements

gdbundle has a couple requirements.

#### Python-compatible GDB

gdbundle requires a GDB compiled with Python. You can check if your GDB is
configured correctly by the following quick test:

```
$ gdb
(gdb) python-interactive
>>> print("TEST")
"TEST"
```

If "TEST" is printed, everything should work! If not, there are a few things to
try:

- Brew and Ubuntu's Apt both install a GDB with Python enabled.
- Your distribution might also include a `*-gdb-py` version with Python enabled.
- Clone [binutils-gdb](https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb) and try compiling
  it with the configuration flag `--with-python`.

#### Modification to `.gdbinit`

Just like Vim plugin managers require the user to edit their `~/.vimrc`,
gdbundle requires a snippet of code to be added to a loaded `.gdbinit` file.

```
# -- GDBUNDLE_EDITS_BEGIN
python

import os,subprocess,sys
# Execute a Python using the user's shell and pull out the sys.path (for site-packages)
paths = subprocess.check_output('python -c "import os,sys;print(os.linesep.join(sys.path).strip())"',shell=True).decode("utf-8").split()
# Extend GDB's Python's search path
sys.path.extend(paths)

import gdbundle
gdbundle.init()

end
# -- GDBUNDLE_EDITS_END
```

As I discussed in a previous post,
[Using PyPi Packages with GDB](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/using-pypi-packages-with-GDB#3-append-syspath-to-gdbs-python),
the first part of this **is required** to be able to use Python packages
installed in a virtual environment, Conda environment, or non-default Python
installation.

The second part, `gdbundle.init()`, is what is new and will load installed
gdbundle plugins.

## gdbundle Example Plugin

I've created a "Hello World" plugin for gdbundle called
[`gdbundle-example`](https://github.com/memfault/gdbundle-example). Let's dig in
and see how it's built.

### Structure

Below is the directory structure of our plugin.

```
├── README.md
├── gdbundle_example
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── scripts
│       ├── example.gdb
│       └── example.py
└── pyproject.toml
```

Simple, right? I've opted to use `pyproject.toml` instead of `setup.py` because
I wanted to embrace the future of standardized packaging, but note that these
packages will work with Python 2 and 3, so it shouldn't matter.

### How It Works

Let's look at the code in `gdbundle_example/__init__.py`

```python
import gdb
import os

ROOT_DIR = os.path.dirname(__file__)

SCRIPT_PATHS = [
    [ROOT_DIR, 'scripts', 'example.gdb'],
    [ROOT_DIR, 'scripts', 'example.py']
]

def _abs_path(path):
    return os.path.abspath(os.path.join(*path))

def gdbundle_load():
    for script_path in SCRIPT_PATHS:
        gdb.execute("source {}".format(_abs_path(script_path)))
```

Notice the module-level `gdbundle_load` function which `gdbundle` will call
directly. When this is called, it takes each script file located in `scripts/`
and tells GDB to `source` it. Notice that both GDB Python and GDB Command
scripts work!

By using `gdb.execute("source <script>")`, plugins can source GDB scripts that
were never designed with gdbundle in mind or designed to be distributed.

## A Few More Examples

Given the flexibility of gdbundle itself, it can allow developer to package up
any of the already existing GDB scripts and make installation easier for
everyone.

Here are a few more examples of plugins I've created that wrap popular packages
that I use frequently.

- [gdbundle-gdb-dashboard](https://github.com/memfault/gdbundle-gdb-dashboard) - gdbundle plugin for
  [cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard](https://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard).
- [gdbundle-PyCortexMDebug](https://github.com/memfault/gdbundle-PyCortexMDebug) - gdbundle plugin for
  [bnahill/PyCortexMDebug](https://github.com/bnahill/PyCortexMDebug).
